* Bekanntes Sprichwort
* Ursprung nicht ganz klar, eine der ersten kommerziellen Verwendungen durch einen Autozubehörhändler.
* Bild zeigt eine Zeitungsanzeige. Ironie: Nur Worte statt Bilder. Aber es geht darum, dass man beim Händler vorbeischauen soll, um die Teile (bspw. Reifen) anzuschauen oder anschauen zu lassen.

## Storytelling with Data 

* What Is Data Storytelling?
  * Data storytelling harnesses the power of data to capture our imagination, without overloading us with dry numbers and statistics.
  * It’s a powerful mixture: data “nuggets” are transformed into imaginative visuals to tell a compelling story

--

* Humans have been using visuals to tell stories long before the internet,

--

* 30,000 years ago, our ancestors painted animals like bison, and depictions of themselves hunting onto cave walls, as well as carving glyphs to communicate other aspects of their prehistoric lives.

--

* Visual storytelling remains an extremely powerful and universally accessible way of sharing ideas and connecting with others.

--

* **Data storytelling** on the web borrows this power to elevate statistics, numbers, and other data that can otherwise get lost in lengthy blocks of text.

## How To Use Data Storytelling

* Data storytelling isn’t just a fancy term for “nicer-looking reports”

--

* From big business to journalism, it’s used imaginatively all over the web to illustrate timelines, communicate facts and 
figures, and display other quantitative information.

--

* Companies use data storytelling for wrap-up annual reports, investor pitches, sustainability and impact reports, awareness campaigns, etc...

--

* It’s a way to differentiate themselves, and to tell brand narratives in a way that holds our attention.

## How To Use Data Storytelling

* Media publications, like newspapers, frequently use data storytelling to tell stories that go beyond what’s possible in print

--

* Data storytelling makes it possible to present facts and statistics in a way that’s more imaginative.

--

* Data storytelling often employsmediums like infographics, data visualisations, interactive maps, and feature articles

--

* Graphics are easier to understand/remember than plain boring numbers in a table

## The business of data storytelling

Here are four reasons organisations should invest in data storytelling:

--

1. **Data storytelling is good for branding**: Data storytelling will help you build a reputation for expertise, which will cement the value of your brand.  

--

2. **Data storytelling performs well**: Data stories tend to perform well on the metrics content marketing teams care about, including time-on-page, bounce rates etc

--

3. **Data storytelling can scale**: you can create amazing-looking data stories without investing in developers

--

4. **Data storytelling can help you know — and grow — your business**: Check rise of amazing data storytelling within organisations, using dashboards and other business analytics tools that data analysts use to generate data insights for their business.

--

* The report broken down into several subsections including engagement, merch, and release, with each section showing Spotify user data, and explaining what it means

## Impossible 

* Impossible has won over many vegetarians as well as meat-eaters with their plant-based products like their popular Impossible Burger

--

* This food impact slider shows the effect meat consumption has on the environment. 

--

* The more you move the slider—which represents replacing eating meat with plant-based options in terms of weight—the more you see your environmental impact reduce.

--

* It’s a powerful graphic that isn’t about shaming us, but showing all the good that can happen to the environment by changing the way we eat.

## The problem with SwD

* There is a LOT of bad graphs out there!

--

* We aren’t naturally good at storytelling with data
  * We learn a lot of math and language at school
  * These two sides are not paired: no one teaches us how to tell stories with numbers.
  
--

* Skilled in Microsoft Office? So is everyone else!

## Simple text

* With just a number or two to share, simple text can be a great way to communicate.

--

* Solely the number (prominent!) and a few supporting words to clearly make your point.

--

* Putting one or only a couple of numbers in a table or graph simply causes the numbers to lose some of their oomph

--

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: '33%'
#| fig-show: 'hold'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic5.png'))
```

---

name: sampleslide
class: left

.blockquote[Storytelling with data: some theory]

## Simple text

* The fact that you have some numbers does not mean that you need
a graph!

--

* In the previus pic the graph doesn’t do much to aid in the interpretation of the numbers

--

* In this case, a simple sentence would suffice: 20% of children had a traditional stay‐at‐home mom in 2012, compared to 41% in 1970.

--

* Or, you can present it as: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: '50%'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic6.png'))
```

## Scatter plot

* Great to show the relationship between two quantities 

--

* Let’s say that we manage a bus fleet and want to understand  the relationship between miles driven and cost per mile

--

* Enhancing the pic around the `Avg` point better helps understanding what's going on 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'default'
#| out-width: '50%'
#| fig-show: 'hold'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic7.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic8.png'))
```

.blockquote[Storytelling with data: some theory]

## Bar plot

* Sometimes bar charts are avoided because they are common. This is a mistake

--

* Rather, bar charts should be leveraged because they are common, as this means less of a learning curve for your audience

--

* Instead of using their brain power to try to understand how to read the graph, your audience spends it figuring out what information to take away from the visual.

--

* Bar charts are easy for our eyes to read. 

--

* Our eyes compare the endpoints of the bars, so it is easy to see quickly which category is the biggest, which is the smallest, and also the incremental difference between categories. 

--

* IMPORTANT: The scaling is **EVERYTHING**

.blockquote[Storytelling with data: some theory]

## Bar plot

* Top tax rate, pre and post (misleading!).

* Why? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: '60%'
#| fig-show: 'hold'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic9.png'))
```
---

name: sampleslide
class: left

.blockquote[Storytelling with data: some theory]

## Bar plot

* Scale starts at 34% and not at 0% 

--

* A 13% increase in tax burden ((39.6 – 35) / 35) becomes visually a 460%

--

* The heights of the bars are 35 – 34 = 1 and 39.6 – 34 = 5.6, so (5.6 – 1) / 1 = 460%

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: '80%'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic10.png'))
```

---

.blockquote[Storytelling with data: some theory]

## The importance of the visual order

* Visual order helps get the message quicker 

--

* The plot on the left is not terrible, but that on the right is better :) 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'default'
#| out-width: '50%'
#| fig-show: 'hold'
knitr::include_graphics(xfun::from_root('img','PVA1','pic11.png'))
