  abstract = {\&quot;Data Products and the Data Mesh\&quot; is a comprehensive guide that explores the emerging paradigm of the data mesh and its implications for organizations navigating the data-driven landscape. This book equips readers with the knowledge and insights needed to design, build, and manage effective data products within the data mesh framework.The book starts by introducing the core concepts and principles of the data mesh, highlighting the shift from centralized data architectures to decentralized, domain-oriented approaches. It delves into the key components of the data mesh, including federated data governance, data marketplaces, data virtualization, and adaptive data products. Each chapter provides in-depth analysis, practical strategies, and real-world examples to illustrate the application of these concepts.Readers will gain a deep understanding of how the data mesh fosters a culture of data ownership, collaboration, and innovation. They will explore the role of modern data architectures, such as data marketplaces, in facilitating decentralized data sharing, access, and monetization. The book also delves into the significance of emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, and machine learning in enhancing data integrity, security, and value creation.Throughout the book, readers will discover practical insights and best practices to overcome challenges related to data governance, scalability, privacy, and compliance. They will learn how to optimize data workflows, leverage domain-driven design principles, and harness the power of data virtualization to drive meaningful insights and create impactful data products.\&quot;Data Products and the Data Mesh\&quot; is an essential resource for data professionals, architects, and leaders seeking to navigate the complex world of data products within the data mesh paradigm. It provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a scalable, decentralized, and innovative data ecosystem that empowers organizations to unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive data-driven success.},

In this practical book, author Zhamak Dehghani reveals that, despite the time, money, and effort poured into them, data warehouses and data lakes fail when applied at the scale and speed of today's organizations. A distributed data mesh is a better choice. Dehghani guides architects, technical leaders, and decision makers on their journey from monolithic big data architecture to a sociotechnical paradigm that draws from modern distributed architecture. A data mesh considers domains as a first-class concern, applies platform thinking to create self-serve data infrastructure, treats data as a product, and introduces a federated and computational model of data governance. This book shows you why and how. Examine the current data landscape from the perspective of business and organizational needs, environmental challenges, and existing architectures Analyze the landscape's underlying characteristics and failure modes Get a complete introduction to data mesh principles and its constituents Learn how to design a data mesh architecture Move beyond a monolithic data lake to a distributed data mesh},
